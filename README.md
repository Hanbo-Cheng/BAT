# Bidirectional Asynchrous Training (BAT) method for HMER
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00435)

Offical implementation of Bidirectional Trained Tree-Structured Decoder for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition

***Under construction***

We will provide all code as soon as the paper is accepted. Due to the company's confidentiality regulations, we cannot take out the original experimental code from the company's intranet. We are now manually reproduce the code and test its integrity. Thanks for your attention!

Our plan: 
  - [x]  prepare the data preprocessing script (2024.4.26)
  - [x]  prepare fore the model and training code (2024.4.26)
  - [ ]  upload the raw data
  - [ ]  upload the processed data
  - [ ]  upload the instruction for training
